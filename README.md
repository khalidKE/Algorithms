## 📌 Descriptions:

### 🔍 Linear Search
- Checks each element one by one.
- Time: O(n)
- Works on unsorted arrays.

### 🔍 Binary Search
- Splits the search space in half each time.
- Time: O(log n)
- Requires a sorted array.

### 🔄 Insertion Sort
- Builds the sorted list as it goes.
- Time: O(n²)
- Efficient for small or nearly-sorted arrays.

### 🔄 Selection Sort
- Selects the smallest element each round.
- Time: O(n²)
- Simple but inefficient.

### 🔀 Merge Sort
- Recursively splits and merges the array.
- Time: O(n log n)
- Stable and efficient, uses extra memory.

### ⚡ Quick Sort
- Uses a pivot to partition the array.
- Time: Avg O(n log n), Worst O(n²)
- Fast in practice, but not stable.

### 🔢 Counting Sort
- Counts occurrences of each number.
- Time: O(n + k)
- Works for small positive integers.

### 🔢 Radix Sort
- Sorts by digit position.
- Time: O(nk)
- Great for large sets of numbers.
